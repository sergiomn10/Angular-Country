# CountryApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

# Topics covered in the project

- Child Routes
- Nested Routes
- Creation and Communication between Components
- Tailwind and DaisyUI
- Routes File per Feature / Module
- Lazy Loading of Route Modules


## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Additional Resources

For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

## Tailwind and DaisyUI are used

[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is a collection of CSS class names. These class names are a high-level abstraction of Tailwind CSS utility classes. Imagine you use Tailwind CSS with superpowers!

## Change style theme

You can change the application theme  to display other colors in style.css. [You can check out daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) page for more themes. 

```code
@plugin "daisyui" {

 themes: sunset --default;

}
```

## The icons in the project
